# Neo Express Contract Invocation File

## Overview

Neo Express uses a JSON file containing contract invocation information, which can be passed by path to the `contract invoke` neo-express command. 

This document describes the initial format of Neo contract invoke files used by Neo Express V3.0 and later versions .

There are several advantages of using a invoke file instead of the command line:

- invoke files can be checked into source control
- invoke files can handle arbitrarily complex sets of arguments, including UTXO information
- invoke files can be generated by tools such as Visual DevTracker

## Invocation File Format

A neo-invoke file is a serialized JSON object that contains the information needed
to invoke a Neo smart contract. The file can have any extension, though it typically
uses `.neo-invoke.json` to both indicate its usage as well as enable JSON syntax
highlighting in tools.

A neo-invoke JSON object has three properties: `contract`, `operation` and `args`.

### `contract` Property

The `contract` property contains information about what contract to invoke. This
property is a JSON object with one of two mutually exclusive properties:

- `hash` is the hex-encoded script hash of the contract to invoke. The format expected
  matches the top level `hash` property of the .abi.json file generated by the [NEON compiler](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-devpack-dotnet).
- `path` is an absolute or relative path to the compiled contract binary (.nef). The script hash of the contract will be calculated at run time by neo-express.

### `operation` Property

For invoking N3 contracts, the operation must be specified by name in the invocation file.

### `args` Property

The `args` property contains an array of contract parameters to be passed to the contact via the invoke script. neo-express generates the invoke script for the contract specified via the `contract` and  `operation` property.

The following JSON types are treated as the corresponding Contract parameter type:

- Boolean
- Integer
  - Note, non-integer JSON numbers are not valid contract parameters. Additionally,
    only integers that fall between [`Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MIN_SAFE_INTEGER) and [`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)
    can be encoded in this manner. Integers that fall outside that range should be
    encoded using the type/value approach detailed above.
- String
- Array

Additionally, direct encoded strings can use special prefixes to indicate other contract
parameter types

- Direct encoded strings with a '0x' prefix are treated as a hex encoded ByteArray
- Direct encoded strings with a '@N' prefix are treated as a base58 encoded Hash160
  value (i.e. Neo wallet addresses)

## Example

Following is an example of invocation file:

``` json
[
    {
        "contract": "token",
        "operation": "transfer",
        "args": [
            "@dev",
            "@genesis",
            1000,
            []
        ]
    },
    {
        "contract": "token",
        "operation": "transfer",
        "args": [
            "@dev",
            "#NFT",
            1000,
            []
        ]
    }
]
```
